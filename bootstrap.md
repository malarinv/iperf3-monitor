# **Architecting a Kubernetes-Native Network Performance Monitoring Service with iperf3, Prometheus, and Helm**

## **Section 1: Architectural Blueprint for Continuous Network Validation**

### **1.1 Introduction to Proactive Network Monitoring in Kubernetes** {#introduction-to-proactive-network-monitoring-in-kubernetes}

In modern cloud-native infrastructures, Kubernetes has emerged as the de
facto standard for container orchestration, simplifying the deployment,
scaling, and management of complex applications.^1^ However, the very
dynamism and abstraction that make Kubernetes powerful also introduce
significant challenges in diagnosing network performance issues. The
ephemeral nature of pods, the complexity of overlay networks provided by
Container Network Interfaces (CNIs), and the multi-layered traffic
routing through Services and Ingress controllers can obscure the root
causes of latency, packet loss, and throughput degradation.

Traditional, reactive troubleshooting---investigating network problems
only after an application has failed---is insufficient in these
environments. Performance bottlenecks can be subtle, intermittent, and
difficult to reproduce, often manifesting as degraded user experience
long before they trigger hard failures.^1^ To maintain the reliability
and performance of critical workloads, engineering teams must shift from
a reactive to a proactive stance. This requires a system that performs
continuous, automated validation of the underlying network fabric,
treating network health not as an assumption but as a measurable,
time-series metric.

This document outlines the architecture and implementation of a
comprehensive, Kubernetes-native network performance monitoring service.
The solution leverages a suite of industry-standard, open-source tools
to provide continuous, actionable insights into cluster network health.
The core components are:

- **iperf3:** A widely adopted tool for active network performance
  > measurement, used to generate traffic and measure maximum achievable
  > bandwidth, jitter, and packet loss between two points.^2^

- **Prometheus:** A powerful, open-source monitoring and alerting system
  > that has become the standard for collecting and storing time-series
  > metrics in the Kubernetes ecosystem.^3^

- **Grafana:** A leading visualization tool for creating rich,
  > interactive dashboards from various data sources, including
  > Prometheus, enabling intuitive analysis of complex datasets.^4^

By combining these components into a cohesive, automated service, we can
transform abstract network performance into a concrete, queryable, and
visualizable stream of data, enabling teams to detect and address
infrastructure-level issues before they impact end-users.^6^

### **1.2 The Core Architectural Pattern: Decoupled Test Endpoints and a Central Orchestrator** {#the-core-architectural-pattern-decoupled-test-endpoints-and-a-central-orchestrator}

The foundation of this monitoring service is a robust, decoupled
architectural pattern designed for scalability and resilience within a
dynamic Kubernetes environment. The design separates the passive test
endpoints from the active test orchestrator, a critical distinction that
ensures the system is both efficient and aligned with Kubernetes
operational principles.

The data flow and component interaction can be visualized as follows:

1.  A **DaemonSet** deploys an iperf3 server pod onto every node in the
    > cluster, creating a mesh of passive test targets.

2.  A central **Deployment**, the iperf3-exporter, uses the Kubernetes
    > API to discover the IP addresses of all iperf3 server pods.

3.  The iperf3-exporter periodically orchestrates tests, running an
    > iperf3 client to connect to each server pod and measure network
    > performance.

4.  The exporter parses the JSON output from iperf3, transforms the
    > results into Prometheus metrics, and exposes them on a /metrics
    > HTTP endpoint.

5.  A **Prometheus** server, configured via a **ServiceMonitor**,
    > scrapes the /metrics endpoint of the exporter, ingesting the
    > performance data into its time-series database.

6.  A **Grafana** instance, using Prometheus as a data source,
    > visualizes the metrics in a purpose-built dashboard, providing
    > heatmaps and time-series graphs of node-to-node bandwidth, jitter,
    > and packet loss.

This architecture is composed of three primary logical components:

- **Component 1: The iperf3-server DaemonSet.** To accurately measure
  > network performance between any two nodes (N-to-N), an iperf3 server
  > process must be running and accessible on every node. The DaemonSet
  > is the canonical Kubernetes controller for this exact use case. It
  > guarantees that a copy of a specific pod runs on all, or a selected
  > subset of, nodes within the cluster.^7^ When a new node joins the
  > cluster, the
  > DaemonSet controller automatically deploys an iperf3-server pod to
  > it; conversely, when a node is removed, the pod is garbage
  > collected. This ensures the mesh of test endpoints is always in sync
  > with the state of the cluster, requiring zero manual
  > intervention.^9^ This pattern of using a
  > DaemonSet to deploy iperf3 across a cluster is a well-established
  > practice for network validation.^11^

- **Component 2: The iperf3-exporter Deployment.** A separate,
  > centralized component is required to act as the test orchestrator.
  > This component is responsible for initiating the iperf3 client
  > connections, executing the tests, parsing the results, and exposing
  > them as Prometheus metrics. Since this is a stateless service whose
  > primary function is to perform a periodic task, a Deployment is the
  > ideal controller.^8^ A
  > Deployment ensures a specified number of replicas are running,
  > provides mechanisms for rolling updates, and allows for independent
  > resource management and lifecycle control, decoupled from the
  > iperf3-server pods it tests against.^10^

- **Component 3: The Prometheus & Grafana Stack.** The monitoring
  > backend is provided by the kube-prometheus-stack, a comprehensive
  > Helm chart that deploys Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager, and the
  > necessary exporters for cluster monitoring.^4^ Our custom monitoring
  > service is designed to integrate seamlessly with this stack,
  > leveraging its Prometheus Operator for automatic scrape
  > configuration and its Grafana instance for visualization.

### **1.3 Architectural Justification and Design Rationale** {#architectural-justification-and-design-rationale}

The primary strength of this architecture lies in its deliberate
separation of concerns, a design choice that yields significant benefits
in resilience, scalability, and operational efficiency. The DaemonSet is
responsible for the *presence* of test endpoints, while the Deployment
handles the *orchestration* of the tests. This decoupling is not
arbitrary; it is a direct consequence of applying Kubernetes-native
principles to the problem.

The logical progression is as follows: The requirement to continuously
measure N-to-N node bandwidth necessitates that iperf3 server processes
are available on all N nodes to act as targets. The most reliable,
self-healing, and automated method to achieve this \"one-pod-per-node\"
pattern in Kubernetes is to use a DaemonSet.^7^ This makes the server
deployment automatically scale with the cluster itself. Next, a process
is needed to trigger the tests against these servers. This
\"orchestrator\" is a logically distinct, active service. It needs to be
reliable and potentially scalable, but it does not need to run on every
single node. The standard Kubernetes object for managing such stateless
services is a

Deployment.^8^

This separation allows for independent and appropriate resource
allocation. The iperf3-server pods are extremely lightweight, consuming
minimal resources while idle. The iperf3-exporter, however, may be more
CPU-intensive during the brief periods it is actively running tests. By
placing them in different workload objects (DaemonSet and Deployment),
we can configure their resource requests and limits independently. This
prevents the monitoring workload from interfering with or being starved
by application workloads, a crucial consideration for any
production-grade system. This design is fundamentally more robust and
scalable than simpler, monolithic approaches, such as a single script
that attempts to manage both server and client lifecycles.^12^

## **Section 2: Implementing the iperf3-prometheus-exporter**

The heart of this monitoring solution is the iperf3-prometheus-exporter,
a custom application responsible for orchestrating the network tests and
translating their results into a format that Prometheus can ingest. This
section provides a detailed breakdown of its implementation, from
technology selection to the final container image.

### **2.1 Technology Selection: Python for Agility and Ecosystem** {#technology-selection-python-for-agility-and-ecosystem}

Python was selected as the implementation language for the exporter due
to its powerful ecosystem and rapid development capabilities. The
availability of mature, well-maintained libraries for interacting with
both Prometheus and Kubernetes significantly accelerates the development
of a robust, cloud-native application.

The key libraries leveraged are:

- **prometheus-client:** The official Python client library for
  > instrumenting applications with Prometheus metrics. It provides a
  > simple API for defining metrics (Gauges, Counters, etc.) and
  > exposing them via an HTTP server, handling much of the boilerplate
  > required for creating a valid exporter.^13^

- **iperf3-python:** A clean, high-level Python wrapper around the
  > iperf3 C library. It allows for programmatic control of iperf3
  > clients and servers, and it can directly parse the JSON output of a
  > test into a convenient Python object, eliminating the need for
  > manual process management and output parsing.^15^

- **kubernetes:** The official Python client library for the Kubernetes
  > API. This library is essential for the exporter to become
  > \"Kubernetes-aware,\" enabling it to dynamically discover the
  > iperf3-server pods it needs to test against by querying the API
  > server directly.

### **2.2 Core Exporter Logic (Annotated Python Code)** {#core-exporter-logic-annotated-python-code}

The exporter\'s logic can be broken down into five distinct steps, which
together form a continuous loop of discovery, testing, and reporting.

#### **Step 1: Initialization and Metric Definition**

The application begins by importing the necessary libraries and defining
the Prometheus metrics that will be exposed. We use a Gauge metric, as
bandwidth is a value that can go up or down. Labels are crucial for
providing context; they allow us to slice and dice the data in
Prometheus and Grafana.

> Python

import os
import time
import logging
from kubernetes import client, config
from prometheus_client import start_http_server, Gauge
import iperf3

\# \-\-- Configuration \-\--
\# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format=\'%(asctime)s -
%(levelname)s - %(message)s\')

\# \-\-- Prometheus Metrics Definition \-\--
IPERF_BANDWIDTH_MBPS = Gauge(
\'iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps\',
\'Network bandwidth measured by iperf3 in Megabits per second\',
\[\'source_node\', \'destination_node\', \'protocol\'\]
)
IPERF_JITTER_MS = Gauge(
\'iperf_network_jitter_ms\',
\'Network jitter measured by iperf3 in milliseconds\',
\[\'source_node\', \'destination_node\', \'protocol\'\]
)
IPERF_PACKETS_TOTAL = Gauge(
\'iperf_network_packets_total\',
\'Total packets transmitted or received during the iperf3 test\',
\[\'source_node\', \'destination_node\', \'protocol\'\]
)
IPERF_LOST_PACKETS = Gauge(
\'iperf_network_lost_packets_total\',
\'Total lost packets during the iperf3 UDP test\',
\[\'source_node\', \'destination_node\', \'protocol\'\]
)
IPERF_TEST_SUCCESS = Gauge(
\'iperf_test_success\',
\'Indicates if the iperf3 test was successful (1) or failed (0)\',
\[\'source_node\', \'destination_node\', \'protocol\'\]
)

#### **Step 2: Kubernetes-Aware Target Discovery**

A static list of test targets is an anti-pattern in a dynamic
environment like Kubernetes.^16^ The exporter must dynamically discover
its targets. This is achieved by using the Kubernetes Python client to
query the API server for all pods that match the label selector of our

iperf3-server DaemonSet (e.g., app=iperf3-server). The function returns
a list of dictionaries, each containing the pod\'s IP address and the
name of the node it is running on.

This dynamic discovery is what transforms the exporter from a simple
script into a resilient, automated service. It adapts to cluster scaling
events without any manual intervention. The logical path is clear:
Kubernetes clusters are dynamic, so a hardcoded list of IPs would become
stale instantly. The API server is the single source of truth for the
cluster\'s state. Therefore, the exporter must query this API, which in
turn necessitates including the Kubernetes client library and
configuring the appropriate Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions
for its ServiceAccount.

> Python

def discover_iperf_servers():
\"\"\"
Discover iperf3 server pods in the cluster using the Kubernetes API.
\"\"\"
try:
\# Load in-cluster configuration
config.load_incluster_config()
v1 = client.CoreV1Api()

namespace = os.getenv(\'IPERF_SERVER_NAMESPACE\', \'default\')
label_selector = os.getenv(\'IPERF_SERVER_LABEL_SELECTOR\',
\'app=iperf3-server\')

logging.info(f\"Discovering iperf3 servers with label
\'{label_selector}\' in namespace \'{namespace}\'\")

ret = v1.list_pod_for_all_namespaces(label_selector=label_selector,
watch=False)

servers =
for i in ret.items:
\# Ensure pod has an IP and is running
if i.status.pod_ip and i.status.phase == \'Running\':
servers.append({
\'ip\': i.status.pod_ip,
\'node_name\': i.spec.node_name
})
logging.info(f\"Discovered {len(servers)} iperf3 server pods.\")
return servers
except Exception as e:
logging.error(f\"Error discovering iperf servers: {e}\")
return

#### **Step 3: The Test Orchestration Loop**

The main function of the application contains an infinite while True
loop that orchestrates the entire process. It periodically discovers the
servers, creates a list of test pairs (node-to-node), and then executes
an iperf3 test for each pair.

> Python

def run_iperf_test(server_ip, server_port, protocol, source_node,
dest_node):
\"\"\"
Runs a single iperf3 test and updates Prometheus metrics.
\"\"\"
logging.info(f\"Running iperf3 test from {source_node} to {dest_node}
({server_ip}:{server_port}) using {protocol.upper()}\")

client = iperf3.Client()
client.server_hostname = server_ip
client.port = server_port
client.protocol = protocol
client.duration = int(os.getenv(\'IPERF_TEST_DURATION\', 5))
client.json_output = True \# Critical for parsing

result = client.run()

\# Parse results and update metrics
parse_and_publish_metrics(result, source_node, dest_node, protocol)

def main_loop():
\"\"\"
Main orchestration loop.
\"\"\"
test_interval = int(os.getenv(\'IPERF_TEST_INTERVAL\', 300))
server_port = int(os.getenv(\'IPERF_SERVER_PORT\', 5201))
protocol = os.getenv(\'IPERF_TEST_PROTOCOL\', \'tcp\').lower()
source_node_name = os.getenv(\'SOURCE_NODE_NAME\') \# Injected via
Downward API

if not source_node_name:
logging.error(\"SOURCE_NODE_NAME environment variable not set.
Exiting.\")
return

while True:
servers = discover_iperf_servers()

for server in servers:
\# Avoid testing a node against itself
if server\[\'node_name\'\] == source_node_name:
continue

run_iperf_test(server\[\'ip\'\], server_port, protocol,
source_node_name, server\[\'node_name\'\])

logging.info(f\"Completed test cycle. Sleeping for {test_interval}
seconds.\")
time.sleep(test_interval)

#### **Step 4: Parsing and Publishing Metrics**

After each test run, a dedicated function parses the JSON result object
provided by the iperf3-python library.^15^ It extracts the key
performance indicators and uses them to set the value of the
corresponding Prometheus

Gauge, applying the correct labels for source and destination nodes.
Robust error handling ensures that failed tests are also recorded as a
metric, which is vital for alerting.

> Python

def parse_and_publish_metrics(result, source_node, dest_node,
protocol):
\"\"\"
Parses the iperf3 result and updates Prometheus gauges.
\"\"\"
labels = {\'source_node\': source_node, \'destination_node\': dest_node,
\'protocol\': protocol}

if result.error:
logging.error(f\"Test from {source_node} to {dest_node} failed:
{result.error}\")
IPERF_TEST_SUCCESS.labels(\*\*labels).set(0)
\# Clear previous successful metrics for this path
IPERF_BANDWIDTH_MBPS.labels(\*\*labels).set(0)
IPERF_JITTER_MS.labels(\*\*labels).set(0)
return

IPERF_TEST_SUCCESS.labels(\*\*labels).set(1)

\# The summary data is in result.sent_Mbps or result.received_Mbps
depending on direction
\# For simplicity, we check for available attributes.
if hasattr(result, \'sent_Mbps\'):
bandwidth_mbps = result.sent_Mbps
elif hasattr(result, \'received_Mbps\'):
bandwidth_mbps = result.received_Mbps
else:
\# Fallback for different iperf3 versions/outputs
bandwidth_mbps = result.Mbps if hasattr(result, \'Mbps\') else 0

IPERF_BANDWIDTH_MBPS.labels(\*\*labels).set(bandwidth_mbps)

if protocol == \'udp\':
IPERF_JITTER_MS.labels(\*\*labels).set(result.jitter_ms if
hasattr(result, \'jitter_ms\') else 0)
IPERF_PACKETS_TOTAL.labels(\*\*labels).set(result.packets if
hasattr(result, \'packets\') else 0)
IPERF_LOST_PACKETS.labels(\*\*labels).set(result.lost_packets if
hasattr(result, \'lost_packets\') else 0)

#### **Step 5: Exposing the /metrics Endpoint**

Finally, the main execution block starts a simple HTTP server using the
prometheus-client library. This server exposes the collected metrics on
the standard /metrics path, ready to be scraped by Prometheus.^13^

> Python

if \_\_name\_\_ == \'\_\_main\_\_\':
\# Start the Prometheus metrics server
listen_port = int(os.getenv(\'LISTEN_PORT\', 9876))
start_http_server(listen_port)
logging.info(f\"Prometheus exporter listening on port {listen_port}\")

\# Start the main orchestration loop
main_loop()

### **2.3 Containerizing the Exporter (Dockerfile)** {#containerizing-the-exporter-dockerfile}

To deploy the exporter in Kubernetes, it must be packaged into a
container image. A multi-stage Dockerfile is used to create a minimal
and more secure final image by separating the build environment from the
runtime environment. This is a standard best practice for producing
production-ready containers.^14^

> Dockerfile

\# Stage 1: Build stage with dependencies
FROM python:3.9-slim as builder

WORKDIR /app

\# Install iperf3 and build dependencies
RUN apt-get update && \\
apt-get install -y \--no-install-recommends gcc iperf3 libiperf-dev &&
\\
rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/\*

\# Install Python dependencies
COPY requirements.txt.
RUN pip install \--no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

\# Stage 2: Final runtime stage
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

\# Copy iperf3 binary and library from the builder stage
COPY \--from=builder /usr/bin/iperf3 /usr/bin/iperf3
COPY \--from=builder /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libiperf.so.0
/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libiperf.so.0

\# Copy installed Python packages from the builder stage
COPY \--from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages
/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages

\# Copy the exporter application code
COPY exporter.py.

\# Expose the metrics port
EXPOSE 9876

\# Set the entrypoint
CMD \[\"python\", \"exporter.py\"\]

The corresponding requirements.txt would contain:

prometheus-client
iperf3
kubernetes

## **Section 3: Kubernetes Manifests and Deployment Strategy**

With the architectural blueprint defined and the exporter application
containerized, the next step is to translate this design into
declarative Kubernetes manifests. These YAML files define the necessary
Kubernetes objects to deploy, configure, and manage the monitoring
service. Using static manifests here provides a clear foundation before
they are parameterized into a Helm chart in the next section.

### **3.1 The iperf3-server DaemonSet** {#the-iperf3-server-daemonset}

The iperf3-server component is deployed as a DaemonSet to ensure an
instance of the server pod runs on every eligible node in the
cluster.^7^ This creates the ubiquitous grid of test endpoints required
for comprehensive N-to-N testing.

Key fields in this manifest include:

- **spec.selector**: Connects the DaemonSet to the pods it manages via
  > labels.

- **spec.template.metadata.labels**: The label app: iperf3-server is
  > applied to the pods, which is crucial for discovery by both the
  > iperf3-exporter and Kubernetes Services.

- **spec.template.spec.containers**: Defines the iperf3 container, using
  > a public image and running the iperf3 -s command to start it in
  > server mode.

- **spec.template.spec.tolerations**: This is often necessary to allow
  > the DaemonSet to schedule pods on control-plane (master) nodes,
  > which may have taints preventing normal workloads from running
  > there. This ensures the entire cluster, including masters, is part
  > of the test mesh.

- **spec.template.spec.hostNetwork: true**: This is a critical setting.
  > By running the server pods on the host\'s network namespace, we
  > bypass the Kubernetes network overlay (CNI) for the server side.
  > This allows the test to measure the raw performance of the
  > underlying node network interface, which is often the primary goal
  > of infrastructure-level testing.

### **3.2 The iperf3-exporter Deployment** {#the-iperf3-exporter-deployment}

The iperf3-exporter is deployed as a Deployment, as it is a stateless
application that orchestrates the tests.^14^ Only one replica is
typically needed, as it can sequentially test all nodes.

Key fields in this manifest are:

- **spec.replicas: 1**: A single instance is sufficient for most
  > clusters.

- **spec.template.spec.serviceAccountName**: This assigns the custom
  > ServiceAccount (defined next) to the pod, granting it the necessary
  > permissions to talk to the Kubernetes API.

- **spec.template.spec.containers.env**: The SOURCE_NODE_NAME
  > environment variable is populated using the Downward API. This is
  > how the exporter pod knows which node *it* is running on, allowing
  > it to skip testing against itself.

- **spec.template.spec.containers.image**: This points to the custom
  > exporter image built in the previous section.

### **3.3 RBAC: Granting Necessary Permissions** {#rbac-granting-necessary-permissions}

For the exporter to perform its dynamic discovery of iperf3-server pods,
it must be granted specific, limited permissions to read information
from the Kubernetes API. This is accomplished through a ServiceAccount,
a ClusterRole, and a ClusterRoleBinding.

- **ServiceAccount**: Provides an identity for the exporter pod within
  > the cluster.

- **ClusterRole**: Defines a set of permissions. Here, we grant get,
  > list, and watch access to pods. These are the minimum required
  > permissions for the discovery function to work. The role is a
  > ClusterRole because the exporter needs to find pods across all
  > namespaces where servers might be running.

- **ClusterRoleBinding**: Links the ServiceAccount to the ClusterRole,
  > effectively granting the permissions to any pod that uses the
  > ServiceAccount.

### **3.4 Network Exposure: Service and ServiceMonitor** {#network-exposure-service-and-servicemonitor}

To make the exporter\'s metrics available to Prometheus, we need two
final objects. The Service exposes the exporter pod\'s metrics port
within the cluster, and the ServiceMonitor tells the Prometheus Operator
how to find and scrape that service.

This ServiceMonitor-based approach is the linchpin for a GitOps-friendly
integration. Instead of manually editing the central Prometheus
configuration file---a brittle and non-declarative process---we deploy a
ServiceMonitor custom resource alongside our application.^14^ The
Prometheus Operator, a key component of the

kube-prometheus-stack, continuously watches for these objects. When it
discovers our iperf3-exporter-sm, it automatically generates the
necessary scrape configuration and reloads Prometheus without any manual
intervention.^4^ This empowers the application team to define

*how their application should be monitored* as part of the
application\'s own deployment package, a cornerstone of scalable, \"you
build it, you run it\" observability.

## **Section 4: Packaging with Helm for Reusability and Distribution**

While static YAML manifests are excellent for defining Kubernetes
resources, they lack the flexibility needed for easy configuration,
distribution, and lifecycle management. Helm, the package manager for
Kubernetes, solves this by bundling applications into
version-controlled, reusable packages called charts.^17^ This section
details how to package the entire

iperf3 monitoring service into a professional, flexible, and
distributable Helm chart.

### **4.1 Helm Chart Structure** {#helm-chart-structure}

A well-organized Helm chart follows a standard directory structure. This
convention makes charts easier to understand and maintain.^19^

iperf3-monitor/
├── Chart.yaml \# Metadata about the chart (name, version, etc.)
├── values.yaml \# Default configuration values for the chart
├── charts/ \# Directory for sub-chart dependencies (empty for this
project)
├── templates/ \# Directory containing the templated Kubernetes
manifests
│ ├── \_helpers.tpl \# A place for reusable template helpers
│ ├── server-daemonset.yaml
│ ├── exporter-deployment.yaml
│ ├── rbac.yaml
│ ├── service.yaml
│ └── servicemonitor.yaml
└── README.md \# Documentation for the chart

### **4.2 Templating the Kubernetes Manifests** {#templating-the-kubernetes-manifests}

The core of Helm\'s power lies in its templating engine, which uses Go
templates. We convert the static manifests from Section 3 into dynamic
templates by replacing hardcoded values with references to variables
defined in the values.yaml file.

A crucial best practice is to use a \_helpers.tpl file to define common
functions and partial templates, especially for generating resource
names and labels. This reduces boilerplate, ensures consistency, and
makes the chart easier to manage.^19^

**Example: templates/\_helpers.tpl**

### **4.3 Designing a Comprehensive values.yaml** {#designing-a-comprehensive-values.yaml}

The values.yaml file is the public API of a Helm chart. A well-designed
values file is intuitive, clearly documented, and provides users with
the flexibility to adapt the chart to their specific needs. Best
practices include using clear, camelCase naming conventions and
providing comments for every parameter.^21^

A particularly powerful feature of Helm is conditional logic. By
wrapping entire resource definitions in if blocks based on boolean flags
in values.yaml (e.g., {{- if.Values.rbac.create }}), the chart becomes
highly adaptable. A user in a high-security environment can disable the
automatic creation of ClusterRoles by setting rbac.create: false,
allowing them to manage permissions manually without causing the Helm
installation to fail.^20^ Similarly, a user not running the Prometheus
Operator can set

serviceMonitor.enabled: false. This adaptability transforms the chart
from a rigid, all-or-nothing package into a flexible building block,
dramatically increasing its utility across different organizations and
security postures.

The following table documents the comprehensive set of configurable
parameters for the iperf3-monitor chart. This serves as the primary
documentation for any user wishing to install and customize the service.

## **Section 5: Visualizing Network Performance with a Custom Grafana Dashboard**

The final piece of the user experience is a purpose-built Grafana
dashboard that transforms the raw, time-series metrics from Prometheus
into intuitive, actionable visualizations. A well-designed dashboard
does more than just display data; it tells a story, guiding an operator
from a high-level overview of cluster health to a deep-dive analysis of
a specific problematic network path.^5^

### **5.1 Dashboard Design Principles** {#dashboard-design-principles}

The primary goals for this network performance dashboard are:

1.  **At-a-Glance Overview:** Provide an immediate, cluster-wide view of
    > network health, allowing operators to quickly spot systemic issues
    > or anomalies.

2.  **Intuitive Drill-Down:** Enable users to seamlessly transition from
    > a high-level view to a detailed analysis of performance between
    > specific nodes.

3.  **Correlation:** Display multiple related metrics (bandwidth,
    > jitter, packet loss) on the same timeline to help identify causal
    > relationships.

4.  **Clarity and Simplicity:** Avoid clutter and overly complex panels
    > that can obscure meaningful data.^4^

### **5.2 Key Visualizations and Panels** {#key-visualizations-and-panels}

The dashboard is constructed from several key panel types, each serving
a specific analytical purpose.

- **Panel 1: Node-to-Node Bandwidth Heatmap.** This is the centerpiece
  > of the dashboard\'s overview. It uses Grafana\'s \"Heatmap\"
  > visualization to create a matrix of network performance.

  - **Y-Axis:** Source Node (source_node label).

  - **X-Axis:** Destination Node (destination_node label).

  - **Cell Color:** The value of the iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps
    > metric.

  - PromQL Query: avg(iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps) by (source_node,
    > destination_node)
    > This panel provides an instant visual summary of the entire
    > cluster\'s network fabric. A healthy cluster will show a uniformly
    > \"hot\" (high bandwidth) grid, while any \"cold\" spots
    > immediately draw attention to underperforming network paths.

- **Panel 2: Time-Series Performance Graphs.** These panels use the
  > \"Time series\" visualization to plot performance over time,
  > allowing for trend analysis and historical investigation.

  - **Bandwidth (Mbps):** Plots
    > iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps{source_node=\"\$source_node\",
    > destination_node=\"\$destination_node\"}.

  - **Jitter (ms):** Plots
    > iperf_network_jitter_ms{source_node=\"\$source_node\",
    > destination_node=\"\$destination_node\", protocol=\"udp\"}.

  - Packet Loss (%): Plots (iperf_network_lost_packets_total{\...} /
    > iperf_network_packets_total{\...}) \* 100.
    > These graphs are filtered by the dashboard variables, enabling the
    > drill-down analysis.

- **Panel 3: Stat Panels.** These panels use the \"Stat\" visualization
  > to display single, key performance indicators (KPIs) for the
  > selected time range and nodes.

  - **Average Bandwidth:** avg(iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps{\...})

  - **Minimum Bandwidth:** min(iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps{\...})

  - **Maximum Jitter:** max(iperf_network_jitter_ms{\...})

### **5.3 Enabling Interactivity with Grafana Variables** {#enabling-interactivity-with-grafana-variables}

The dashboard\'s interactivity is powered by Grafana\'s template
variables. These variables are dynamically populated from Prometheus and
are used to filter the data displayed in the panels.^4^

- **\$source_node**: A dropdown variable populated by the PromQL query
  > label_values(iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps, source_node).

- **\$destination_node**: A dropdown variable populated by
  > label_values(iperf_network_bandwidth_mbps{source_node=\"\$source_node\"},
  > destination_node). This query is cascaded, meaning it only shows
  > destinations relevant to the selected source.

- **\$protocol**: A custom variable with the options tcp and udp.

This combination of a high-level heatmap with interactive,
variable-driven drill-down graphs creates a powerful analytical
workflow. An operator can begin with a bird\'s-eye view of the cluster.
Upon spotting an anomaly on the heatmap (e.g., a low-bandwidth link
between Node-5 and Node-8), they can use the \$source_node and
\$destination_node dropdowns to select that specific path. All the
time-series panels will instantly update to show the detailed
performance history for that link, allowing the operator to correlate
bandwidth drops with jitter spikes or other events. This workflow
transforms raw data into actionable insight, dramatically reducing the
Mean Time to Identification (MTTI) for network issues.

### **5.4 The Complete Grafana Dashboard JSON Model** {#the-complete-grafana-dashboard-json-model}

To facilitate easy deployment, the entire dashboard is defined in a
single JSON model. This model can be imported directly into any Grafana
instance.

## **Section 6: GitHub Repository Structure and CI/CD Workflow**

To deliver this monitoring service as a professional, open-source-ready
project, it is essential to package it within a well-structured GitHub
repository and implement a robust Continuous Integration and Continuous
Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This automates the build, test, and release
process, ensuring that every version of the software is consistent,
trustworthy, and easy for consumers to adopt.

### **6.1 Recommended Repository Structure** {#recommended-repository-structure}

A clean, logical directory structure is fundamental for project
maintainability and ease of navigation for contributors and users.

.
├──.github/
│ └── workflows/
│ └── release.yml \# GitHub Actions workflow for CI/CD
├── charts/
│ └── iperf3-monitor/ \# The Helm chart for the service
│ ├── Chart.yaml
│ ├── values.yaml
│ └── templates/
│ └──\...
└── exporter/
├── Dockerfile \# Dockerfile for the exporter
├── requirements.txt \# Python dependencies
└── exporter.py \# Exporter source code
├──.gitignore
├── LICENSE
└── README.md

This structure cleanly separates the exporter application code
(/exporter) from its deployment packaging (/charts/iperf3-monitor), and
its release automation (/.github/workflows).

### **6.2 CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions** {#cicd-pipeline-with-github-actions}

A fully automated CI/CD pipeline is the hallmark of a mature software
project. It eliminates manual, error-prone release steps and provides
strong guarantees about the integrity of the published artifacts. By
triggering the pipeline on the creation of a Git tag (e.g., v1.2.3), we
use the tag as a single source of truth for versioning both the Docker
image and the Helm chart. This ensures that chart version 1.2.3 is built
to use image version 1.2.3, and that both have been validated before
release. This automated, atomic release process provides trust and
velocity, elevating the project from a collection of files into a
reliable, distributable piece of software.

The following GitHub Actions workflow automates the entire release
process:

### **6.3 Documentation and Usability** {#documentation-and-usability}

The final, and arguably most critical, component for project success is
high-quality documentation. The README.md file at the root of the
repository is the primary entry point for any user. It should clearly
explain what the project does, its architecture, and how to deploy and
use it.

A common failure point in software projects is documentation that falls
out of sync with the code. For Helm charts, the values.yaml file
frequently changes, adding new parameters and options. To combat this,
it is a best practice to automate the documentation of these parameters.
The helm-docs tool can be integrated directly into the CI/CD pipeline to
automatically generate the \"Parameters\" section of the README.md by
parsing the comments directly from the values.yaml file.^20^ This
ensures that the documentation is always an accurate reflection of the
chart\'s configurable options, providing a seamless and trustworthy
experience for users.

## **Conclusion**

The proliferation of distributed microservices on Kubernetes has made
network performance a critical, yet often opaque, component of overall
application health. This report has detailed a comprehensive,
production-grade solution for establishing continuous network validation
within a Kubernetes cluster. By architecting a system around the robust,
decoupled pattern of an iperf3-server DaemonSet and a Kubernetes-aware
iperf3-exporter Deployment, this service provides a resilient and
automated foundation for network observability.

The implementation leverages industry-standard tools---Python for the
exporter, Prometheus for metrics storage, and Grafana for
visualization---to create a powerful and flexible monitoring pipeline.
The entire service is packaged into a professional Helm chart, following
best practices for templating, configuration, and adaptability. This
allows for simple, version-controlled deployment across a wide range of
environments. The final Grafana dashboard transforms the collected data
into an intuitive, interactive narrative, enabling engineers to move
swiftly from high-level anomaly detection to root-cause analysis.

Ultimately, by treating network performance not as a given but as a
continuously measured metric, organizations can proactively identify and
resolve infrastructure bottlenecks, enhance application reliability, and
ensure a consistent, high-quality experience for their users in the
dynamic world of Kubernetes.
